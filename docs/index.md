# GFW Python Client

`gfw_client_lib` is a light-weight, fully typed wrapper around the  
[Global Fishing Watch **Gateway v3** API](https://docs.globalfishingwatch.org/).

The goal is **rapid prototyping**: authenticate with your personal API token
and start querying vessels, tracks, events, port-visits, risk scores
& more in just a few lines of Python.
