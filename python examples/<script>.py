Placeholder file created by mistake during documentation generation.

This file is **not** an executable example.  It only exists so that the
repository stays syntactically valid when tools like `flake8` scan every
`*.py` file.  Feel free to delete it or ignore it; all real runnable
examples live in the `examples/` directory.
